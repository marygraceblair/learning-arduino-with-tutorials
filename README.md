# Learning Arduino With Tutorials
One of my 2024 new years resolutions is to learn more about hardware with Arudino.
This will be a compilation of the online tutorials and online resources that I have followed
and found helpful on my journey to learn Arduino. 

## The Tutorials
* Experimenter's Guide for Arduino (ARDX) by seeed studio and oomlout
    This is a beginners hardware kit that includes some schematics for 13 simple circuits. The kit that I am using appears to be discontinued, but
    the information provided can still be found online. The PDF of the manual for my edition can be found [here] (https://content.instructables.com/F3J/MTJN/FVW22MXN/F3JMTJNFVW22MXN.pdf). Similar hardware kits are still being sold through the adafruit website, including a hardware kit for the METRO board, which appears to be an expanded version of my kit.
* Exploring Arduino; Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry by Jeremy Blum
    This is a super informative book about arduino that also includes some tutorials. I believe this will be a great resource as it goes more in-depth about hardware and electrical engineering principles.  
* Arduino Projects Book by Adafruit
    I believe this book was provided with one of the starter kits for Arduino. It has some information about electrical engineering principles, but mainly focuses on projects.
